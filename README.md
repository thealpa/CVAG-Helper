# CVAG-Helper
Helper script that matches public transport coordinates from VMS open data to CVAG's ITCS API mandator numbers.

**This script is no longer needed since VMS provides stop ids and coordinates using their EFA API.**

See also my corresponding [iOS app](https://github.com/thealpa/cvag).

## Usage

1. Download and unzip the latest [VMS GTFS dataset](https://www.vms.de/vms/open-data-gtfs-daten/)
2. Replace stops.txt with the latest you just downloaded
3. Run `python3 cvag.py`
